    <h3>
        What am I doing?
    </h3>
    <p>
        By day I work as a video game tester and by night I make pointless games that will never be released.

        What skill I have and where have I acquired them?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Mostly self taught Unity developer skills, in my opinion beginner level C# coding skills and some art skills.
    I can also mention my hyper duper video game tester skills, but in reality it's not that hyper duper and more of mediocre.
